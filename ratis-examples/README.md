# Apache Ratis Examples

#### Building and Running The Examples

Compile the repository using `mvn clean package -DskipTests` under the project root directory;
see also [BUILDING.md](../BUILDING.md).

All the scripts for running the examples are located in the [ratis-examples/src/main/bin](src/main/bin) directory,

## Example 1: FileStore

**FileStore** is file service supporting *read*, *write* and *delete* operations.
The **FileStoreStateMachine** is implemented using the asynchronous event-driven model.
The source code is located in
* [ratis-examples/src/main/java/org/apache/ratis/examples/filestore/](src/main/java/org/apache/ratis/examples/filestore).


#### Server
To spawn a *FileStore* server, run
* `server.sh filestore server --id <SELF_ID> --storage <STORAGE_DIR> --peers <ID:IP_ADDRESS,...>`

where `<SELF_ID>`, which must be in the peer list, is the id of the instance being spawned.

For example `ratis-examples/src/main/bin/server.sh filestore server --id n0 --storage /tmp/data --peers n0:xx.xx.xx.xx:6000,n1:yy.yy.yy.yy:6001,n2:zz.zz.zz.zz:6002`

#### Client

To spawn a *FileStore* load generation client, run
* `client.sh filestore loadgen --size <FILE_SIZE> --numFiles <NUM_FILES> --peers <ID:IP_ADDRESS,...>`

where `<FILE_SIZE>` is the size of the files to be generated in bytes,
`<NUM_FILES>` is the number of files to be generated.

For example `ratis-examples/src/main/bin/client.sh filestore loadgen --size 1048576 --numFiles 1000 --peers n0:xx.xx.xx.xx:6000,n1:yy.yy.yy.yy:6001,n2:zz.zz.zz.zz:6002`

## Example 2: Arithmetic

**Arithmetic** is an implementation of a replicated state machine.
A *variable map* is stored in the *ArithmeticStateMachine* which supports *assign* or *get* operations.
Clients may assign a variable to a value by specifying either the value or a formula to compute the value.

In [TestArithemetic](src/test/java/org/apache/ratis/examples/arithmetic/TestArithmetic.java),
it uses Arithmetic to solve *Pythagorean* equation and compute &pi; using Gaussâ€“Legendre algorithm.

The source code is located in
* [ratis-examples/src/main/java/org/apache/ratis/examples/arithmetic/](src/main/java/org/apache/ratis/examples/arithmetic).

#### Server
To spawn an *Arithmetic* server, run
* `server.sh arithmetic server --id <SELF_ID> --storage <STORAGE_DIR> --peers <ID:IP_ADDRESS,...>`

where `<SELF_ID>`, which must be in the peer list, is the id of the instance being spawned.

For example `ratis-examples/src/main/bin/server.sh arithmetic server --id n0 --storage /tmp/data --peers n0:xx.xx.xx.xx:6000,n1:yy.yy.yy.yy:6001,n2:zz.zz.zz.zz:6002`

#### Client

To run an *Arithmetic* client command, run
* `client.sh arithmetic get --name <VAR> --peers <ID:IP_ADDRESS,...>`

or
* `client.sh arithmetic assign --name <VAR> --value <VALUE> --peers <ID:IP_ADDRESS,...>`

where `<VAR>` is the name of the variable and `<VALUE>` is the value to be assigned.

For example `ratis-examples/src/main/bin/client.sh arithmetic get --name b --peers n0:xx.xx.xx.xx:6000,n1:yy.yy.yy.yy:6001,n2:zz.zz.zz.zz:6002`

## Pre-Setup Vagrant Pseudo Cluster
One can see the interactions of a three server Ratis cluster with a load-generator running against it
by using the `run_all_tests.sh` script found in [dev-support/vagrant/](../dev-support/vagrant).
See the [dev-support/vagrant/README.md](../dev-support/vagrant/README.md) for more on dependencies and what is setup.
This will allow one to try a fully setup three server Ratis cluster on a single VM image,
preventing resource contention with your development host and allowing failure injection too.
